While the lo mein was ok, the amazing chicken was amazingly bad. It was more like chicken jerky. And the fried rice was the worst I ever had. The meal was inedible. I called to complain but nothing was done to make the situation right. Would not recommend!",1.0,Cannot find the business on the Cocoapreneur,I do not plan on continuing to support Project 100 Reviews in the foreseeable future.

The taste is either salty or greasy now. Also they also seems short handed at dinner time. Tables are fairly small for groups and not enough leg rooms. Used to be an ideal place for Chinese food.,2.0,Cannot find the business on the Cocoapreneur,In the next two weeks
