All three entrees were delicious and the portion size is an excellent value. It's hard to say which one was my favorite because they were all amazing, but I think I'll go with the jerk chicken. It was too spicy for my wife, but perfect for me. The flavors were bold and peppery with a hint of sweet. The brown stew chicken tasted like buttery gravy with a touch of Caribbean flare. The spice level was very mild. Second favorite! And goat stew had more of a yellow curry flavor with tender cubes of goat meat. It was also much less spicy than the jerk chicken. The rice was a great consistency and the perfect way to sop up some extra sauce. We ordered online and the food was ready within a couple minutes of arriving. We will definitely order from here again, I can't wait to try the rest of the menu.",5,Cannot find the business on the Cocoapreneur,In the next month

Friendly staff and good selection of their bagged coffee beans and some other coffee accessories. I love to order a latte and a blueberry muffin and enjoy it outside on a warm day. It might not be a good place to study because it is not too bright and could get really crowded and busy during peak hours.,5,Cannot find the business on the Cocoapreneur,In the next week

The staff was friendly and our drinks were made pretty quickly. We tried the strawberry green tea with crystal boba and milk foam and peach green tea with nata jelly. It was my first time trying milk foam and I thought it complimented the tea well, a sort of salty/savory top of the drink. They were both super refreshing drinks in the hot Pittsburgh weather.I am definitely coming back, there are so many drinks on the menu I want to try. They also have waffles with ice cream so I want to try that too!",5,Yes,I do not plan on continuing to support Project 100 Reviews in the foreseeable future.

The Provoletta is great and a must try as well, if your in the strip, stop at Gaucho and grab a sandwich or steak, you won't be disappointed.Update- I went to their new location downtown for takeout to get their Bondiola sandwich, which is pork, caramelized onions, Dijon on their fresh bread, it was unreal. I have never been disappointed with a meal from there. Their new location is really unique and cool, it's too bad with Covid-19 it isn't able to be enjoyed fully.",5,Yes,In the next two months

I was impressed by the size and very happy with the taste. The style of the restaurant and the way that you order is cafeteria style. I like it - it helps speed up the process. There are side sauces that you pour yourself (near the entrance) so you can tailor your spice preference. I really liked the taste of the grilled red peppers and onions; the sandwich is relatively plain otherwise (which is great). The bun is a nice thick bread that absorbs the meat ahhh so yummy. The price is somewhat steep but you do get a decent bit of good steak so IMO it is worth the splurge every once in a while.,5,No,In the next two weeks

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we dined in and had a great meal with friendly and speedy service. Tram's Kitchen's staff were even able to accommodate our picky five year old. We've ordered takeout several times recently, and I've got to say that it hits the spot as a comforting and flavorful meal. The beef pho and shrimp and pork Saigon soup both feature rich and complex broths with rice noodles, fresh vegetables, and proteins. The banh mi are delicious and shine thanks to fresh ingredients.",5,Yes,In the next month
