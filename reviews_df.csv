1,Took Took 98 (Thai Street Food Restaurant),Manjari Das,1.0,"Used to love. But when they don't take into account the selected splice level, it ruins the experience. I used to order level 3. Now level 1 burns the tongue after one bite"
2,Took Took 98 (Thai Street Food Restaurant),Daniel Klein,5.0,"We decided to try a new restaurant last night, and we're not disappointed! First of all, they were very good at maintaining social distancing, and the restaurant felt very clean. When we got home, the food was delicious and delightful! The thing that appealed to me most was that I had the opportunity to try things that I had never had before."
3,Took Took 98 (Thai Street Food Restaurant),April Clisura,4.0,"This is a good place to order delivery during social distancing. They did a good job and were on time. The chicken pineapple fried rice was very good and just a little hotter than we expected having ordered a 3 level. The pumpkin curry was flavorful, with nice basil garnish, but much thinner than other Thai pumpkin curry I have had - maybe this is more typical of street food style. It was also much spicier than expected having ordered a 3 level. But with that being the case I was able to add my own coconut milk and have lots of extra curry sauce. The fried eggplant appetizer was great. The stuffed crispy wonton did not have a lot of filling and the pastry got a little darkened. A good value for the money overall so this will just make it to 4 stars."
